 Results of our pre-trained model over a small landscape dataset (only 2000 image) with **CUDA** Api.

# Overview
An automatic colorization for greyscale images based on convolutional neural network (CNN).

This is a **Tensorflow** version with **pyhton** of the ColorNet issued on [SIGGRAPH 2016](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/en/). Please check out the original website for the details.
They have done the good job and provide a pre-tarined model with **Torch**.

This is an implementation only and doesn't include a pre-trained model ( we may provide it later ), so you must train the model befor testing it.
